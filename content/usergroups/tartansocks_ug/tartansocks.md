Welcome to the Scottish OpenShift, Containers and Kubernetes user group page. Our group is aimed at local communities of users in Scotland but we welcome anyone into our group!

The ethos of our group is that it's owned by users, customers and partners or anyone who wants to be part of a local discussion surrounding the OpenShift, Containers and Kubernetes ecosystem. 

We are currently kicking off with virtual events that we hope are short and useful! What we are really looking forward to is the time when we can get together with pizza, beer and good conversation! Until then, here's our schedule of virtual meetups.

## [Register for Next Meeting](https://events.redhat.com/profile/form/index.cfm?PKformID=0x309682abcd)

| Thursday 25th February        |           |        
| ------------- |---------------| ----------|
| **View from product management.** Whats new in OpenShift 4.7 and what are we working on.     | **Duncan Hardie** | 30 mins |
| **Running minesweeper on Windows on OpenShift.** A quick demo and overview of how easy it is to get a Windows VM/workload running as a VM/Container on OpenShift Virtualisation, which is a core and included component of the OpenShift product from Red Hat.       | **Ian (Uth) Lawson**     |  30 mins  |
| **The Evolution of Distributed Systems on Kubernetes.** Creating good distributed applications is not an easy task: such systems often follow the 12-factor app and microservices principles. They have to be stateless, scalable, configurable, independently released, containerized, automatable, and sometimes event-driven and serverless. Once created, they should be easy to upgrade and affordable to maintain in the long term. Finding a good balance among these competing requirements with today’s technology is still a difficult endeavor. During this talk, Bilgin will take you on a journey exploring distributed application needs and how they evolved with Kubernetes, Istio, Knative, Dapr, and other projects. By the end of the session, you will know what is coming after microservices. | **Bilgin Ibryam**  |    30 mins |
