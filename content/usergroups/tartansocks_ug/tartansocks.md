Welcome to the Scottish OpenShift, Containers and Kubernetes user group page. Our group is aimed at local communities of users in Scotland but we welcome anyone into our group!

The ethos of our group is that it's owned by users, customers and partners or anyone who wants to be part of a local discussion surrounding the OpenShift, Containers and Kubernetes ecosystem. 

We are currently kicking off with virtual events that we hope are short and useful! What we are really looking forward to is the time when we can get together with pizza, beer and good conversation! Until then, here's our schedule of virtual meetups.
