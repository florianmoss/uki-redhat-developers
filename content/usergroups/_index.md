User groups are one of the great things that we get involved in. The intention with our user groups is that we are a collection of tech users that come together to talk about whatever we want to! In our virtual world we try to keep our meetings short and interesting. Lookng forward, we'll see a return to pizza and beer, face to face meetings... ah we can dream! Get in touch if you'd like to join, help run or set up a brand new user group in your area and we can help!
