The OpenShift Ireland User Group is mainly aimed at existing 
OpenShift users in Ireland but is also open to professionals 
that are looking to find out more about [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) and to learn

knowledge transfer and exchange of experiences. The user group
will focus on presenting and discussing real workloads that 
customers are running and have customer presentations focus on 
such. If youâ€™d like to find out more, please get in
