Chances are, you already know a good bit about OpenShift - so there is not really a need to discuss what OpenShift is. But maybe you
just joined a team that is working with OpenShift, or you are familiar with Kubernetes and you'd like to hear more about a complete Kubernetes
platform like OpenShift, then please this section will cover some basics.

Alternatively, I would recommend having a look at the following [publication.](https://www.redhat.com/cms/managed-files/cl-openshift-kubernetes-primer-technichal-detail-f13237wg-201807-en.pdf?intcmp=701f2000000RQykAAG&extIdCarryOver=true&sc_cid=701f2000001Css5AAC)

If you are a visual learner, the following videos are a great starting point:
